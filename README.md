# LinearRegressionProject
This linear regression project works through the steps of the data science pipeline including Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Model Building and Model Evaluation. It uses features like mileage, engine size, brand, body-type, engine type and whether or not the car has been registered to predict the price of a second-hand car.
